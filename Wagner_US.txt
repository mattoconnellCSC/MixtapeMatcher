1. As a new user, I want to find my friends via facebook or contact syncing, so that I don’t have to type in each person’s user name.
2. As a user, I want to easily upload my playlists, so that I don’t have to fiddle too much with the application just to get it to work.
3. As a user, I want to be able to save the song info of songs that I like, so that I can later download them on other music apps.
